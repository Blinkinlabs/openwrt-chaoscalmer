This repo is customized for the VoCore2, most of it is standard OpenWrt Chaos 
Calmer. The instrucitons for building OpenWrt are below.

Unique features:
Includes vocore audio drivers and the proprietary Mediatek 
wifi driver
Builds separate images for single board, ultimate, beta and lite variants
Has spi driver backported from Lede which allows half duplex operation
Has separate images for spidev and using a second flash chip as mtd.

To build for the VoCore2 follow the standard instructions below with these
additions:
Select Ralink RT288x/RT3xxx for Target System
Select MT7628 based boards for Subtarget
Select your desired hardware variant for Target Profile

Don't Forget to update and install feeds or you will lose wifi!!!

Standard instructions:
***************************************************************************
This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

Please use "make menuconfig" to configure your appreciated
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make,
find, grep, diff, unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers.

Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to get all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default respectively
and "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks of all of them into
package/feeds/.

Use "make menuconfig" to configure your image.

Simply running "make" will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

You can use "scripts/flashing/flash.sh" for remotely updating your embedded
system via tftp.

The OpenWrt system is documented in docs/. You will need a LaTeX distribution
and the tex4ht package to build the documentation. Type "make -C docs/" to build it.

To build your own firmware you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system
(case-sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin will not be supported because of
the lack of case sensitiveness in the file system.
